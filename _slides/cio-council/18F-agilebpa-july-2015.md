## Backstory

--
Become a **trusted partner** for agencies
--
Our mission is to transform government from the inside out, **changing culture** by working with teams inside agencies who want to create great services for the public
--
### How we work 

We will accomplish our mission by:

* putting the needs of the public first
* being design-centric, agile, open, and data-driven
* deploying tools and services early and often
---
# Delivery is the strategy
---
### Prototypes > Proposals
---
### Services that are simple, beautiful, and easy to use
---
### How do we all "ship" transformative culture change?
---
#### Core plumbing

* practices
* processes
* people
---
## Agile Delivery Services BPA
---
## Backstory
Initial demand for 18F was greater than we had capacity to deliver on. 

We knew we needed to partner with the private sector. Would vendors embrace **how we work**, or reject it?
---
## Government can design + create a **streamlined marketplace** for **agile delivery services**
---
### Hypothesis

Great vendors **will** work with government, if we change expectations, by replacing proposals with prototype evaluations.
--
### Prototypes > Proposals
--
#### Code > Claims

### Results

We ended up with 200+ submissions and the overall quality exceeded our expectations.

## How 18F can improve

* More automated tests

* Require data-validation of hyperlinks instead of narratives for evidence

* Create distributed technical evaluation teams to increase speed and quality 
---
## What comes next

* Finish *best value* evaluation

* On track for awards by end of summer or early fall.

* Alpha: Task orders by 18F for 18F Projects that support our partner agencies. We expect task orders to be smaller than traditional government buys.

* Beta: Embracing modular and incremental procurements. Beta may be bigger, either in # of vendors or $, or may radically change based upon what we learn

### Goal is to iterate and learn _quickly_.
