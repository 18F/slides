Software will be the least important

> [O]utside the ordered universe [is] that amorphous blight of nethermost confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the center of all infinity—the boundless daemon sultan Azathoth, whose name no lips dare speak aloud, and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond time and space amidst the muffled, maddening beating of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine of accursed flutes.

> - H. P. Lovecraft, "The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath", in At The Mountains of Madness

> Hello, Pythonistas!

> Ohio had a good, strong representation at PyCon this year.  One thing we agreed on is that The Time Has Come for PyOhio (or perhaps OhPyO, let's figure that out).  Imagine a daylong miniconference bringing people from across the state and beyond.  Let's do it!

> Pardon me for splicing you into our conversation like this, but here are some of the thoughts we've been kicking around so far.
