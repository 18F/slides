# Agenda

* What is Modular Contracting?
* What are the benefits?
* What are the drawbacks?
* How do you _do_ it effectively?

## What is modular contracting?
--
### Legal definition #1
"Modular contracting" means use of one or more contracts to acquire information technology systems in successive, interoperable increments. ~~ FAR 39.002
--
### Legal definition #2
"Adequate Incremental Development - For development of software or services, planned and actual delivery of new or modified technical functionality to users occurs at least every six months." ~~ M-15-14, Management and Oversight of Federal Information Technology
--
### Raines Rules

* "isolating custom-designed components to minimize the potential adverse consequences on the overall project"
* "using fully tested pilots, simulations, or prototype implementations before going to production"
--
### Raines Rules (cont'd)

* "implemented in phased, successive chunks as narrow in scope and brief in duration as practicable, each of which solves a specific part of an overall mission problem and delivers a measurable net benefit independent of future chunks"
* "employ an acquisition strategy that appropriately allocates risk between government and contractor, effectively uses competition, ties contract payments to accomplishments, and takes maximum advantage of commercial technology."
--
## My definition

* chunked "components"
* "loosely coupled"

## "Components"

* self-contained
* internally coherent
* delivered in time-limited iterations

## "Components"

### Heuristics?

* can you realistically state what value you’ll receive 30 days into your contract?
* what concrete value will be delivered to users at the end of the contract?

## "Loose coupling"

* component should not be concerned of or dependent on the inner operations of another system's component
--
## "Loose coupling"

* component should not be concerned of or dependent on the inner operations of another system's component
* *corollary*: multiple vendors should be ***able*** to deliver each component independently, provided that there is an agreed-upon interface

* Expect *evolutionary* interfaces based on *real needs*.

## "Loose coupling"

> Since we didn’t know exactly what the data looked like ahead of time, the team decided to make the data broker’s schema flexible and editable by non-technical people, so as the official DATA Act standard – written by Treasury officials working with participating agencies – changed over time, we could keep iterating.

--
## "Loose coupling"

> “The 18F prototype allowed actual data to drive feature development of both the schema and the application,” [Kaitlin] Devine said. This flexibility allowed us to work out technical problems while refining the data standard and “saved us months, maybe years, of learning some of these early lessons the hard way.”
