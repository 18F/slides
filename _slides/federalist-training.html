# Concepts
---
## The Problem
--
#### Compliance is hard

* A basic .gov page can cost $75000 - $150000 to certify as compliant.
* Every piece of complexity makes compliance more difficult.
--
#### Federalist protects hosting
Users can't access the build or hosting processes
You can only mess with your own site's content.
--
#### The Proxy
* This loads the content from S3 at a URL like https://federalist-proxy.app.cloud.gov/site/18f/federalist-modern-team-template/
* It also adds headers for security
--
#### The Content Delivery Service
* This puts all of the content on a custom URL like https://federalist-modern-team-template.18f.gov/
---
## Federalist Components
--
#### The Builder

* This loads your GitHub content then runs a build process to generate web pages
--
#### The Deployer

* This takes the output of the build process and drops it into a hosting service called "S3"
* Example S3 URL: http://cg-06ab120d-836f-49a2-bc22-9dfb1585c3c6.s3-website-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/site/18f/federalist-modern-team-template/
