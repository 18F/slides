# Concepts
---
## The Problem
--
#### Compliance is hard
* A basic .gov page can cost $75000 - $150000 to certify as compliant, even if all public data
* Every piece of complexity makes compliance more difficult.
--
#### Federalist protects hosting
* You don't have direct access to your website
* You can change only your site's content.
* See architecture diagram on https://federalist-docs.18f.gov/pages/how-federalist-works/
---
## Static vs Dynamic
--
#### Static sites are harder to attack
* There's no server to "take over" or "hack," unlike with a dynamic web server
* Instead, there are only files to be downloaded.
* This means that the whole website is easier to maintain and has fewer vulnerabilities.
--
#### Static sites are easier to securely customize
* Designers and developers can customize without having to strip away CMS-provided features and defaults
---
## Federalist Components
--
#### GitHub
* This is where you change your web content!
* When you make a change on GitHub, GitHub sends a "webhook" to Federalist to start the build process.
--
#### The Builder & Deployer
* The builder loads your web content off GitHub and then "builds" all of the web pages on your site.
* The deployer takes your web pages and drops them into a hosting service called "S3"
--
#### The Hosting
* S3 = "Simple Storage Service"
* Like a fileserver
* Example S3 URL: [http://cg-06ab120d-836f-49a2-bc22-9dfb1585c3c6.s3-website-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/site/18f/federalist-modern-team-template/](http://cg-06ab120d-836f-49a2-bc22-9dfb1585c3c6.s3-website-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/site/18f/federalist-modern-team-template/)
--
#### The Proxy
* This displays the content from S3 at a URL like [https://federalist-proxy.app.cloud.gov/site/18f/federalist-modern-team-template/](https://federalist-proxy.app.cloud.gov/site/18f/federalist-modern-team-template/)
* It also adds headers for security
--
#### The Content Delivery Service
* This displays all of the content from the proxy at a URL like [https://federalist-modern-team-template.18f.gov/](https://federalist-modern-team-template.18f.gov/)

# Federalist Screens
---
## Build History
--
The builds table shows the last 100 builds that Federalist did and what happened.
--
#### Actions
* Restart: tells Federalist to immediately kick off a new build for a branch.
* Logs: For debugging, shows you the longer logs from the build.
---
## GitHub Branches
--
A table showing what Federalist has built before. There are two columns.
--
#### Actions
* View Site: view the URL for that branch if it was built
* Trigger Build: force a branch to rebuild
---
## Uploaded Files
--
A table showing what Federalist has built before. There are two columns.
--
####  Branch
Lists all of the different branch names Federalist has built for you.
--
#### Actions
* View: Allows you to view the site as last deployed for that branch.
* Files: For debugging, allows you to verify which files were published by Federalist for the branch.
---
## Collaborators
--
A table showing all of the users with access to Federalist config.
--
#### Actions
* View Site: Remove User - removes a site from that users's list of Federalist sites. They can't add the site back without repo access.
---
## Settings
--
#### Default Branch
Where you keep you "production" code on GitHub. You should consider protecting this branch!
--
#### Static Site Engine
Tells Federalist how it should build your site - or if Federalist shouldn't build anything if the build happens before content goes to GitHub.
--
#### GitHub Branches
Shows you a list of current GitHub branches and links to view builds for each.
--
#### Custom Domain
This tells Federalist to build your "production" site to load content from a different location. Set this immediately after your site has launched on its new URL.
--
#### Demo Site
Allows you to deploy another production-like version of your site for final approvals at custom urls, such as [https://staging.login.gov](https://staging.login.gov).
--
#### Site / Preview Configuration
For experts: these settings allow you to give special instructions to the Federalist build process.

# Exercises
---
## X causes Y exercise
--
### If you edit your master branch...
--
#### ....Federalist will change your live site!
--
### If you create a new branch...
--
#### ....Federalist builds a preview at [https://federalist-proxy.app.cloud.gov/preview/18f/nsf-sbir/<branch-name>/](https://federalist-proxy.app.cloud.gov/preview/18f/nsf-sbir/<branch-name>/)
--
### If you merge a pull request...
--
#### ....Federalist builds out the merged code in the pull request's target branch at [https://federalist-proxy.app.cloud.gov/preview/18f/nsf-sbir/<branch-name>/](https://federalist-proxy.app.cloud.gov/preview/18f/nsf-sbir/<branch-name>/)
--
### If you delete a branch...
--
#### ....Federalist leaves the old branch content alone
--
### If you try to save bad code in GitHub...
--
#### ....Federalist's build will break and you'll need to check the logs. The previous build stays up.
--
### If you save sensitive data on GitHub...
--
#### ....you need to follow your organization's procedures for managing that situation, as everything on Github is public.
