# Concepts
---
## Git
--
####Problem

* Have you ever dealt with multiple copies of a document floating around?
* You end up with "draft with fred comments" and "final" and "final final for release" versions of the same text.
--
####Version Control

* Multiple edits from multiple parties can be tracked in one place
* Ability to "jump" back in time (finding bugs)
--
####Git is a tool that allows developers to do version control.
---
## GitHub
--
Web Interface for Git used by [many government agencies](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/08/08/facts-about-publishing-open-source-code-in-government/).
--
Can see changes made like a [typo fix](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/commit/5d718cfdcaab861ad584c685667120ffd50178f5)
--
Platform for the rest of the concepts today
---
## Orgs
--
Orgs "own" various GitHub projects under version control. Examples: [github.com/18F](https://github.com/18F), [github.com/whitehouse](https://github.com/whitehouse)
--
Your personal projects live under your GitHub account. Example: [Will's GitHub Profile](https://github.com/wslack?tab=repositories)
---
## Repository (or Repo)
--
A repo is a folder with version control you view on GitHub. It lives in an an org or personal account.

---
## Commit
--
A commit is like saving a new version, but smarter.
--
Git remembers not only the status of everything in the repo, but also your specific changes
---
## Branch
--
Branches are little version sandboxes in the repo for other people working on the project to prepare contributions without interfering with the main project.
--
The main project branch is usually called "master."
---
## Fork
--
Forks are copies of the repo that live on someone else's property, with their own branches.
---
## Pull Requests
--
* You have a separate branch or fork with your change.
* You are *requesting* that commits from one place be *pulled* into the main branch.
* When that happens, it is called a *merge*.
--
* You can continue to make edits in the branch until the pull request is merged.
* This is an easy way to make sure that someone else reviews code changes, and provides a permanent record of the review.
---
## Issue
--
These are conversations on GitHub, associated with a repo.
Used for the public to file ideas, comments, or suggestions.
--
Example issues page: [18F/hourofcode](https://github.com/18F/hourofcode/issues)
---
## Markdown
--
Markdown is designed so that text can be easily converted to HTML.
--
This slide deck is [written in Markdown](https://github.com/18F/slides/edit/18f-pages/_slides/github-basics.md)!
Wikipedia has [information on Markdown syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Example).
---
# Practice
* Three activities and screenshot guides follow for
  * Making an issue
  * Making your own test repository and a file in it.
  * Editing your file and creating a pull request
* [Link for practice activity on an 18F Repo](https://pages.18f.gov/hourofcode/)
