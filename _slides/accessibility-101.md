# Welcome to 18F's accessibility course
---
Accessibility is the practice of designing products to ensure a consistent experience for all individuals regardless of physical or mental abilities.
---
Accessibility is an important aspect of web development and has a wide range of benefits for any site or application:
- It ensures your content is available to the broadest possible user base
- It improves search engines’ ability to read your site
- It creates a better experience for everyone
---
As we note in our Accessibility Guide, the least important part is
called [508
Compliance](https://www.section508.gov/summary-section508-standards),
the law that requires all federal Electronic and Information Technology
(EIT) products to be accessible. Though 508 and accessibility are
related, this course will emphasize the larger concerns of
accessibility, which will encompass 508 requirements.
---
Accessibility works best when incorporated into every step of
development. This course will cover:

-   What accessibility is and how it relates to 508 compliance
-   A look at screen readers and other tools for people with disabilities
-   Common accessibility problems and solutions
-   Tools to check various design elements for accessibility standards
-   Resources to learn more about accessibility
-   Resources to make sure your product is 508 compliant

## Reaching users with accessibility

Design shouldn’t serve merely a subset of its audience; it should serve
everyone, equally. Doing that, however, requires thoughtful
conversations before, during, and after development begins.
---
Accessible design addresses the needs of many groups of users including:

-   People who are blind or have low vision
-   People who are deaf or hearing impaired
-   People who are color blind
---
Combined, there are **tens of millions** of people in the U.S. with these
disabilities. Ensuring they have complete access to federal digital
services is both the correct design decision and required by federal
law.
---
A good way to think about this is to consider sloped sidewalks. They
were designed so people using a wheelchair could just as easily access
sidewalks as everyone else. But by addressing the need for people in
wheelchairs, sloped sidewalks also help mothers with strollers, delivery
people pushing dollies, and kids on their bikes. By designing for people
with disabilities, the entire experience is improved. We should do the
same for websites.

## Accessibility vs. 508 compliance

508 compliance refers to Section 508 of the [Rehabilitation Act of
1973](https://www.section508.gov/section508-laws), which requires
“Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology
(EIT) accessible to people with disabilities.”
---
Section 508 is an important list of compliance standards, but we prefer
to have our products meet the [Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php) (WCAG) and,
specifically, their [WCAG 2.0 AA
standard](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/). The guidelines in
this course will meet both the 508 and WCAG 2.0 AA standards.
---
Thinking about these guidelines as accessibility best practices instead
of 508 compliance measures will also help integrate them into
development from the beginning and improve the level of accessibility.
---
Though we’ve gathered a bunch of useful resources and tutorials here,
**this is by no means the full breadth of the world of accessibility.**
There are huge collections of information out there, and we’ll provide
you with links to some of the best. But this course will get you set up
and will continue to grow as we improve our accessibility resources.

## What’s next

Now that you’ve got a good handle on the basics of accessibility, let’s
dive into the techniques you can use to make your site more accessible.

The following sections are broken up into small design areas (images,
forms, contrast), and each section should only take a couple minutes to
complete.

After you’ve finished all the sections, you’ll be given access
to the GitHub repo of a mock website. You’ll be asked to put into
practice the accessibility skills you’ve learned by fixing some problems
in the repo.

After that, we’ll give you a bunch of tools and resources
to prepare you for future projects.
