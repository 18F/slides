--
Platform for the rest of the concepts today
---
## Org
--
These are groups in Github. Examples: [18F](github.com/18F), [WhiteHouse](github.com/whitehouse)
--
You can have your own Github stuff under your username. Example: [Will's GitHub Profile](https://github.com/wslack?tab=repositories)
---
## Repository (or Repo)
--
A repo is a folder with version control you view on GitHub. It lives in an an org or profile.

---
## Commit
--
A commit is like saving a new version, but smarter.
--
Git remembers not only the status of everything in the repo, but also your specific change
---
## Branch
--
Branches are little version sandboxes in the repo for other people working on the project to prepare contributions without interfering with the main project.
--
The main project branch is ususally called "master."
---
## Fork
--
Forks are copies of the repo that live on someone else's property, with their own branches.
---
## Pull Requests
--
* You have a separate branch or fork with your change.
* You are *requesting* your change to be *pulled* into the main branch.
* When that happens, it is called a *merge*.
---
## Issue
--
These are conversations that GitHub associated with a repo.
