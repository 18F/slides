## GitHub
--
Web Interface for Git
--
Can see changes made like a [spelling correction](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/commit/2df683fe1ef04f89ee77672d85ec35a11fec96d3)
--
Platform for the rest of the concepts today
---
## Org
--
These are groups in Github. Examples: [18F](github.com/18F), [WhiteHouse](github.com/whitehouse)
--
You can have your own Github stuff under your username. Example: [Will's GitHub Profile](https://github.com/wslack?tab=repositories)
---
## Repository (or Repo)
--
A repo is a folder with version control you view on GitHub within an an org or profile.

---
## Commit
--
A commit is like saving a new version, but smarter.
--
Git remembers not only the status of everything in the repo, but also your specific change
---
## Branch
--
The main project branch is ususally called "master."

Branches are little version sandboxes in the repo for other people working on the project to prepare contributions without interfering with the main project.
--

---
## Fork
--
Forks are copies of the repo that live on someone else's property, with their own branches.
---
## Pull Requests
--
* You have a separate branch or fork with your change.
* You are *requesting* your change to be *pulled* into the main branch.
* When that happens, it is called a *merge*.
---
## Issue
--
These are conversations that GitHub associated with a repo.
Example issues page: [18F/hourofcode](https://github.com/18F/hourofcode/issues)

---
## Summary 
Create Repo>Make a Commit>Crate a branch>Fork other projects>Pull request>Merge

Remember- All repos require a README file
---
## Markdown
--
Markdown is designed so that text can be easily converted to HTML.
--
This slide deck is [written in Markdown](https://github.com/18F/slides/edit/18f-pages/_slides/github-basics.md)!
